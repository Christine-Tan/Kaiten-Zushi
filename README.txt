1. If you play it on laptop, please click on Maximize on Play, otherwise the objects are messy.1. Once the app is installed, you can choose the level and camera mode from the main panel on top of screen.2. When selecting conveyers/plate/chef, the corresponding control panel will appear on the left of screen, you can edit the parameters of that game object and save them. Click on “Save” button will lead the selected object to be unselected. Click on “Cancel” button as well as click again on the selected object will leave no change to the parameters.3. In the player mode, there is a control panel for you to move the camera. When the “fix” toggle is on, the control panel is for rotate the camera (change the yaw and pitch). The camera will move or rotate following the corresponding button you click on.4. The timer for each table is 15 now. Once the plate is finished, it will disappear silently. However, if the plate is dropped, dragged out of sphere, dragged to a table with 4 plates already or collided with another plate, it will be destroyed with a sound.5.When you drag the plate onto the table, you have to make sure that the plate does not collide with other plates on the table.6. When the camera is in player mode. The camera can only move up, down, forward or backward.When the Fix toggle is on, the player can change the yaw and pitch of camera.
7. When the plate tries to exit the sphere, it will be destroyed. I did not force it to its previous position.
8. When there is a plate in front of the chef, I simply make it disappear. The chef may make another plate.
Missing features1.I implemented “select sauce” in code, but since it is really hard for me to click/touch on the sauce, so I did not test this feature.
2.When the user click on the conveyer, all the plate on them will stop. However, I did not stop the sauce or scoop on the plate.
Explanation of bugs in your code and Unity1. It is really hard for me to click on the “sauce” of the special plate. Things are too small on my mobile device. Anytime I tried to click on the sauce, it shows that I click on the plate or the conveyer.
2. When the conveyer start to move again, sometimes the plate will not start moving immediately. I need to drag the plate a little, then it will behave normal(moving with the conveyer’s new speed).
3. The camera view sometimes failed to return to its original restaurant view after changing the camera position/rotation in player view.
